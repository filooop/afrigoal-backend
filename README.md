3. **Download the File**
   Click on the assets link (e.g., `afrigoal-backend-v1.0.zip`) to start downloading the application. Downloading may take a few moments, depending on your internet connection.

4. **Extract the Files**
   Once the download is complete, locate the file in your downloads folder. You’ll need to extract the files. If you’re using Windows, right-click on the file and select “Extract All.” For Mac users, double-click the file to start extraction.

5. **Run the Application**
   - Open the extracted folder.

     - **Windows**: Type `cmd` in the search bar and press enter.

   - Change the directory to the folder where you extracted the files. For example, if you extracted the folder to your Desktop, type:
     ```
     cd Desktop/afrigoal-backend
     ```
   - After navigating to the correct directory, run the following command:
     ```
     python run_backend.py
     ```

6. **Access the Application**
   Once the application is running, you can access it by opening a web browser. Type `http://127.0.0.1:8000` into the address bar. This will connect you to the backend and you will be able to fetch AFCON team data as needed.
